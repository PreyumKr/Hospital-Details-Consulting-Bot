# Hospital-Details-Consulting-Bot

It is  a **Future Ready Talent Project Repository** created to showcase the use of azure chatbot services in the medical line of work.
---
The Website and chatbot works best only in pc or desktop screen and if opened on mobile screen the components gets mixed with each other and disrupt the functionality. 
---
The chatbot remains open in the begining but it won't disturb the users as the users can hide the bot using the **Health-ChatBot Button** just next to the chat bot.<br>

The chatbot tells the users about the details of the hospital, description about diseases and since it is the era of corona it also tells the user about covid-19 and its precautionary measures.

---
The website also contains links for my instagram, facebook and linkedin profiles.It also contains my contact number and my email-id so if the project invigilator wants to contact me for any reason they can refer to those information.

**Example of the chatbot uses:-**
  * Say Hi to ***Raj*** your healthGuide.
  * Ask him his name and interact with him.
  * Say Covid prevention to learn about covid-19 prevention
  * Say covid/corona to learn about corona
  * Type Help to learn about what the bot can do.
  * The bot can't tell about any and all departments present in any real hospital. It is just for demonstration so it contains info about only departments contained in the website.
