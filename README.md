# Hospital-Details-Consulting-Bot

It is  a **Future Ready Talent Project Repository** created to showcase the use of azure chatbot services in the medical line of work.
---
The Website and chatbot works best only in pc or desktop screen and if opened on mobile screen the components gets mixed with each other and disrupt the functionality. 
---
The chatbot remains open in the begining but it won't disturb the users as the users can hide the bot using the **Health-ChatBot Button** just next to the chat bot.<br>

---
The chatbot tells the users about the details of the hospital, description about diseases and since it is the era of corona it also tells the user about covid-19 and its precautionary measures.
---
---
The names used in the contact details provided by the bot are all imaginary and none of those names refer to any real person. Any resemblence of the details with real life people is purely coincidental.
---
---
The website also contains links for my instagram, facebook and linkedin profiles. It also contains my contact number and my email-id so if the project invigilator wants to contact me for any reason they can refer to those information.
